                    Meanwhile, Einstein’s relationship with Maric deepened, but his parents vehemently opposed the relationship. His mother especially objected to her Serbian background (Maric’s family was Eastern Orthodox Christian). Einstein defied his parents, however, and in January 1902 he and Maric even had a child, Lieserl, whose fate is unknown. (It is commonly thought that she died of scarlet fever or was given up for adoption.)</p>

                        In 1902 Einstein reached perhaps the lowest point in his life. He could not marry Maric and support a family without a job, and his father’s business went bankrupt. Desperate and unemployed, Einstein took lowly jobs tutoring children, but he was fired from even these jobs.

                        The turning point came later that year, when the father of his lifelong friend Marcel Grossmann was able to recommend him for a position as a clerk in the Swiss patent office in Bern. About then, Einstein’s father became seriously ill and, just before he died, gave his blessing for his son to marry Maric. For years, Einstein would experience enormous sadness remembering that his father had died thinking him a failure.

                        <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Mileva Marić (1903-1919): Einstein's first wife was Mileva Marić, a fellow student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. They were married in 1903 and had two sons, Hans Albert and Eduard. However, their marriage faced challenges, and they eventually separated in 1914 and divorced in 1919. The reasons for their separation are complex and involve both personal and professional factors.

Elsa and Albert Einstein remained married until her death in 1936.

                        The General Theory of Relativity has stood the test of time through numerous experimental verifications and continues to be a cornerstone of modern physics. Its profound insights into the nature of gravity have not only shaped our understanding of the cosmos but have also influenced fields as diverse as astrophysics, cosmology, and the study of the large-scale structure of the universe. Einstein's elegant formulation has left an indelible mark on the trajectory of theoretical physics and remains a testament to the power of human intellect in unraveling the mysteries of the universe.

                        With a small but steady income for the first time, Einstein felt confident enough to marry Maric, which he did on January 6, 1903. Their children, Hans Albert and Eduard, were born in Bern in 1904 and 1910, respectively. In hindsight, Einstein’s job at the patent office was a blessing. He would quickly finish analyzing patent applications, leaving him time to daydream about the vision that had obsessed him since he was 16: What would happen if you raced alongside a light beam? While at the polytechnic school he had studied Maxwell’s equations, which describe the nature of light, and discovered a fact unknown to James Clerk Maxwell himself—namely, that the speed of light remains the same no matter how fast one moves. This violates Newton’s laws of motion, however, because there is no absolute velocity in Isaac Newton’s theory. This insight led Einstein to formulate the principle of relativity: “the speed of light is a constant in any inertial frame (constantly moving frame).”
