                        <h4><a href="#">General relativity and teaching career of Albert Einstein</a></h4>
                      </div>

                      <p class="mb-30">At first Einstein’s 1905 papers were ignored by the physics community. This began
                        to change after he received the attention of just one physicist, perhaps the most influential
                        physicist of his generation, Max Planck, the founder of the quantum theory.
                        <br><br>Soon, owing to Planck’s laudatory comments and to experiments that gradually confirmed
                        his theories, Einstein was invited to lecture at international meetings, such as the Solvay
                        Conferences, and he rose rapidly in the academic world. He was offered a series of positions at
                        increasingly prestigious institutions, including the University of Zürich, the University of
                        Prague, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, and finally the University of Berlin, where
                        he served as director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics from 1913 to 1933 (although
                        the opening of the institute was delayed until 1917).
                      </p>
                      <p class="mb-30">One of the deep thoughts that consumed Einstein from 1905 to 1915 was a crucial
                        flaw in his own theory: it made no mention of gravitation or acceleration. His friend Paul
                        Ehrenfest had noticed a curious fact. If a disk is spinning, its rim travels faster than its
                        centre, and hence (by special relativity) metre sticks placed on its circumference should
                        shrink. This meant that Euclidean plane geometry must fail for the disk. For the next 10 years,
                        Einstein would be absorbed with formulating a theory of gravity in terms of the curvature of
                        space-time. To Einstein, Newton’s gravitational force was actually a by-product of a deeper
                        reality: the bending of the fabric of space and time.
                        <br><br>In November 1915 Einstein finally completed the general theory of relativity, which he
                        considered to be his masterpiece. In the summer of 1915, Einstein had given six two-hour
                        lectures at the University of Göttingen that thoroughly explained an incomplete version of
                        general relativity that lacked a few necessary mathematical details. Much to Einstein’s
                        consternation, the mathematician David Hilbert, who had organized the lectures at his university
                        and had been corresponding with Einstein, then completed these details and submitted a paper in
                        November on general relativity just five days before Einstein, as if the theory were his own.
                        Later they patched up their differences and remained friends. Einstein would write to Hilbert,
                      </p>
                      <blockquote>I struggled against a resulting sense of bitterness, and I did so with complete
                        success. I once more think of you in unclouded friendship, and would ask you to try to do
                        likewise toward me.</blockquote>
                      <p class="mb-30">Today physicists refer to the action from which the equations are derived as the
                        Einstein-Hilbert action, but the theory itself is attributed solely to Einstein.
                        <br><br>
                        Einstein was convinced that general relativity was correct because of its mathematical beauty
                        and because it accurately predicted the precession of the perihelion of Mercury’s orbit around
                        the Sun (see Mercury: Mercury in tests of relativity). His theory also predicted a measurable
                        deflection of light around the Sun. As a consequence, he even offered to help fund an expedition
                        to measure the deflection of starlight during an eclipse of the Sun.
